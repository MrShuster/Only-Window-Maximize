# Maximize Lonely Window
a gnome extension in which maximizes the only window in a workspace

I work with workspaces, and I want to focus on my work as much as possible and not get distracted with window managment.
This extension makes it so that if for example there are 2 windows in a workspace and you close one of them, the one that's left will become maximized.
if a window is the single window in a workspace, why not make it maximized? makes sense to me.

works great with maximize-to-empty-workspace extension:
